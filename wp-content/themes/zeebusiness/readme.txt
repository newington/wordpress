===================================
A) Requirements
===================================

The theme has been tested on all major browsers including Firefox 2 & 3.6, Opera 9.5 & 10, 
Internet Explorer 7 & 8 and Safari 3.2.Your browser should have JavaScript enabled to make this theme work!
For example the DropDown Navigation and the Content Slider need Javascript to work.

The theme works on the latest Wordpress version without any problems. Previous versions have not been tested
and are not supported. I suggest to update your wordpress installation, especially due to security flaws.

===================================
B) Installation
===================================

   1. Automatic Installation
      Go to WP-Admin > Appearance > Themes > Install Themes > Upload and choose the theme zip folder.

   2. Manual Installation
      Upload the theme files to your wordpress theme folder wp-content/themes and activate the theme in
      your wordpress admin panel. That's it!

To find out more about installing WordPress themes please also see the WordPress documentation.

===================================
C) Wordpress Options
===================================

Afterwards you should read a few more detailed explanations about the features and recommended settings
of your downloaded theme.

   1. Post Thumbnails
      This theme uses the wordpress post_thumbnail function. You can easily add your thumbnail in every post
      by clicking on Set featured image in the Featured Image box on the right, upload your picture and click
      Use as featured image.

   2. Media Settings
      The size of your thumbnail images is set in your wordpress media settings and can be changed at 
      WP-Admin > Settings > Media. The theme uses medium_size in single posts and pages and thumbnail_size
      in index and archiv files.

   3. Pagination
      The theme includes css styles for the 'wp_pagenavi' plugin. Simply download the plugin here and 
      install it to use pagination.

===================================
D) Theme Options
===================================

The theme contains an own admin page for further settings. Login to your Wordpress admin panel and go to 
WP-Admin > Appearance > “zeeBusiness” Options. There are several settings to change the logo, structure and
layout of your theme. Furthermore you can manage the Featured Post Slider and 125x125 Ad Spots. 
Every theme option is quite well explained so there shouldn't be any questions.

These settings should definitely reduce the launch time for your wordpress blog. For any other changes which
can't be made with the admin page you have to manually change the files.

===================================
E) Theme Colors
===================================

My theme comes with a couple of color skins from which you can select one in the theme option panel. 
You can also choose the custom color skin and add your own hex color code via the theme option panel.

All styles are stored in the folder /includes/styles. There is a CSS file and a image folder for each color,
which you can manually change or even add new ones. So you have the opportunity to create individual and 
unlimited skins for your theme. Have fun!

===================================
F) Page Templates
===================================

I have included a few, nice page templates for advanced content presentation.

   1. Full Width Template
      This template shows the page content in full-width without any sidebars.

   2. Sitemap Template
      Shows a Sitemap with the latest posts, pages, categories and archives.

===================================
G) Theme License
===================================

zeeBusiness is released under the GNU general public license. 
That means you can use this theme on all of your pages - for personal or commercial purposes

===================================
Enjoy!
