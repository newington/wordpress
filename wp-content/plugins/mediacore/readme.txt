Available for existing MediaCore users.

== Description ==

= Media management made easy =

Restrictions on file size, storage and file types within WordPress regularly
present barriers to WordPress users who are keen to embed rich, high quality
multimedia. The MediaCore plugin for WordPress makes it easy to enhance your
posts with video, audio, documents and images directly from your MediaCore
site.

= Harness the power of video learning =

Video is transforming education, and MediaCore helps hundreds of educational
institutions around the world embrace it. The MediaCore Video Platform puts
powerful video learning and sharing tools into the hands of every student and
professor — empowering them to easily capture, manage and share video privately
and securely across all platforms and mobile devices.

* **Browse**, **search** and **securely embed** media from your MediaCore library
into WordPress in one-click.
* **Upload** large video, audio, document or image files (up to 20 GB in size)
into your MediaCore library from within WordPress.
* Automatically **convert** uploaded media into formats supported on devices
including mobile, tablets and desktops.
