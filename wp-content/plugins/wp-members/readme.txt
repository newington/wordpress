WP-Members&trade; is a free membership management system for WordPress&reg; that restricts content to registered users.

== Description ==

WP-Members&trade; is a plugin to make your WordPress&reg; blog a membership driven site.  Perfect for newsletters, premium content sites, and more!  The plugin restricts selected WordPress&reg; content to be viewable by registered site members.  Unlike other registration plugins and WordPress&reg; itself, WP-Members&trade; puts the registration process inline with your content (and thus your branded theme) instead of the native WP login page.  WP-Members&trade; works "out-of-the-box" with no modifications to your theme, but it is scalable for users that want to customize the look and feel, or want to restrict only some content.  It is a great tool for sites offering premium content to subscribers, and is adaptable to a variety of applications.

= Features: =

* Can block posts, pages, both, or none by default
* Can override the default block setting at the individual post/page level
* Login/Registration inline with content rather than the WP login page
* User registration and member information management integrated into your theme
* Sidebar login widget
* Create custom registration fields
* Can set which fields display and which are required
* Notify admin of new user registrations
* Hold new registrations for admin approval
* Turn registration off completely (for admins that want to control registration in some other way)
* Show excerpt on pages/posts for better SEO
* Optional CAPTCHA for registration
* Action and filter hooks for extensibility

By default, WordPress&reg; allows all content to be "open" and viewable by anyone and allows the site owner to restrict specific content if desired by setting a password for the post.  WP-Members&trade; operates with the reverse assumption.  It restricts all posts by default but allows the site owner to "unblock" content as desired.  WP-Members&trade; also offers the ability to change the default plugin settings.  For those that simply want to utilize the member management features and possibly restrict some content, the default setting can easily be toggled to block or unblock pages and/or posts by default.  No matter what the default setting, individual posts or pages can be set to be blocked or unblocked at the article level, overriding the default setting.

The plugin installs with additional custom fields to the registration process including name, address, phone, and email. Using the WP-Members&trade; admin panel, you can create additional fields and delete existing ones as well as drag-and-drop the order of fields.  All of the registration process is inline with your theme and content rather than using the WordPress&reg; login page.  This offers you a premium content site with a professional and branded look and feel.  It also provides an opportunity for the user to register without leaving the page to do so - less clicks = more conversions.

There are also some special pages that can be created with simple shortcodes:

* A Members Area where registered members can edit their information and change/reset their password.  
* A registration page available for those that need a specific URL for registrations (such as email marketing or banner ad landing pages).  Note: this is strictly optional as a registration form can also be included by default on blocked content pages.  
* A login page.  This is also an optional page as the login form is included by default on blocked content.  But if you need a specific login page, this can be created with a simple shortcode.


== Installation ==

WP-Members&trade; is designed to run "out-of-the-box" with no modifications to your WP installation necessary.  Please follow the installation instructions below.  We have found that most of the support issues that arise are a result of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions.  

= Basic Install: =

We recommend following the instructions in the [Quick Start Guide](http://butlerblog.com/wp-members/wp-members-quick-start-guide/).  There is also a complete [Users Guide available](http://butlerblog.com/wp-members/) that covers all of the plugin's features in depth.

1. Upload the `/wp-members/` directory and its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress&reg;

You are ready to begin using WP-Members&trade;.  Now follow the instructions titled "Locking down your site" below.

NOTE: Please follow instructions for installation. We have found that the vast majority of people that have marked the plugin as "broken" in the plugin compatibility form simply did not read/follow installation instructions. If something is unclear, ask for assistance.

= Locking down your site: =

* To begin restricting posts, you will need to be using the `<!--more-->` link in your posts.  Content above to the "more" split will display on summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be required to login to view the entire post.
* To begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for pages to be blocked. The `<!--more-->` link is not necessary in the blocking of pages, but must be used if you have the "show excerpts" setting turned on.
* To protect comments, we recommend setting "Users must be registered and logged in to comment" under Settings > Discussion
* Also on the page Settings > General, we recommend making sure "Anyone can register" is unchecked.  Although not required, this will prevent WP's native registration from colliding with WP-Members&trade;, especially if you are using any of the WP-Members&trade; additional registration fields.
* Under Settings > Reading, we recommend that "For each article in a feed, show" is set to "Summary."  WordPress&reg; installs with full feed settings by default. If you don't change this, your feeds will show full content.


= Additional Settings and Information = 

A full Users Guide is available at the [plugin's homepage](http://butlerblog.com/wp-members).  The guide outlines the installation process, and also documents how to use all of the settings.

= Special and Optional Shortcode Pages =

* If you want to have your users be able to edit their login information, add a new page (not a post) and in the body of this page, place the shortcode [wp-members page="members-area"] where you want WP-Members&trade; to display its content.  This page will allow registered members to edit their information or change their password, and will display the registration form for new members.  This page also handles forgotten password reset for users who are not logged in.  (If you are using the default permalinks, i.e. http://yoursite.com/?p=123, then you must be certain this page title is "Members Area". Check Settings > Permalinks to see your settings.)
* If you would like to have a page to direct users for registrations, you can set up a registration page. (A registration page is not required as the the default settings for the plugin offer user registration in place of restricted content.)  Similar to the "members area" page setup, create a new page (not a post) and in the body of the page, put the shortcode [wp-members page="register"] (Just like the members area, if you are using default permalinks, you must title this page "Register".)
* In order to display a "forgot password" and "register" link in the login form (and sidebar widget), specify the location of the members area and register pages in the plugin options.

Note: the above shortcodes CANNOT be used on the same page!

Major rewrite of the way WP-Members handles the_content() so that it will return a value rather than echo it.  Working to better integrate with other shortcodes so they are propery parsed.  New WP-Members shortcodes will added in future versions.
* Registration fields can now be customized via the admin panel.  This includes adding new fields and deleting non-native fields, and also changing the field order.

= 2.5.4 =

This is a bug fix release. 2.5.3 introduced a bug where the random password sent to a new user was invalid. While the fix is simple, the nature of the bug related to the functionality of the plugin dictates a full update so that users unaware of the bug will be notified via their WP admin panel.

= 2.5.3 =

This is primarily a bug fix release.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed reCAPTCHA from trying to validate on the User Edit page even though reCAPTCHA is not used on this page.

* Corrected the CAPTCHA to not show up on members settings update.
* Plugin checks to see if the reCAPTCHA library is already loaded to be compatible with other reCAPTCHA plugins.
* Fixed activate user function for bulk activation - checks to see if the user is already activated and if so, skips that user so we don't accidentally activate users that are already activated in bulk mode, thus resetting their passwords.
* Updated login process to use wp_signon (wp_login is deprecated).
* Updated sidebar widget include a new css class #wp-members .err for login error message
* Updated sidebar widget to use the appropriate `<li>` tag into the sidebar area.  This should only be a factor for users that customized css. In this case, you'll need to update your stylesheet for ID #wpmem_login_side to #wp-members.
* Updated the sidebar login to better direct the user upon successful login (previously working fine on individual posts and pages, but not on categories).
* *Strictly Experimental* - Introducing pluggable functions - laying the ground work, won't be official yet, so some functions may be deprecated and/or modified.

New Features

Adds a number of features put off from the 2.2 release

Additionally, I added the ability to determine what fields will show in the registration form (both native WP fields, and additional WP-Members&trade; fields).  Also, the error/dialog messages can now be managed from with the admin panel as well.
